/// A dividend is a corporate action that pays shareholders an amount of cash.
/// The cash changes ownership on the ex date, and is paid on the payment date,
/// usually a short settlement period later. In European exchanges, the cash
/// amount is announced well in advance, and is paid into an escrow account
/// so it will be paid regardless of how well the equity itself is trading at
/// the ex date. For asian stocks, this is not always the case, and the amount
/// settled can vary even after the ex date.
///
/// European announced dividends are generally modelled as cash amounts.
/// Dividends further in the future may be modelled as relative amounts,
/// paying a fraction of the equity forward value just before the ex date.
/// Middle-term dividends may be modelled as a mix of cash and relative
/// amounts.
///
/// Some banks, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, store all dividends
/// as cash amounts, and then frig the analytics to treat some proportion of
/// these as relative. This results in broken dynamics and problems for P&L
/// attribution. We therefore follow the simpler model of banks such as Citi,
/// where the cash and relative amounts are stored externaly and passed to
/// the analytics.
///
/// When the dividend pays in the currency of the underlying equity, the
/// currency need not be supplied. The currency is required for foreign
/// currency dividends. (For example, BP is a GBP-based equity, but pays
/// its dividends in USD.)
